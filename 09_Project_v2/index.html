            Hello, my name is Alex Abades and I'm an Artificial Intelligence engineer, 
            currently finishing my master's at DTU. 
        </p>
        <p>
            While I am doing my master's I decided to study HTML and CSS due to a 
            own project. Afterwards, I'll learn about API's for deploying my DP models.
        </p>
        <p class="longtext">
            This it´s just a line to see how the paragraph line space changes. So, in order to see it, we need to have a line long enough to last at least two lines. And as the 
            web page is responsive and I´m currently working in a big monitor I have to write a lot to make the paragraph two lines. Now it just started a second line, but if 
            I stop now I wont be able too clearly see the difference.
