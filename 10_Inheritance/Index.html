        <div>
            <p>Even if we set the style to purple, the anchor element still has its default color. ThatÂ´s because the anchor element has its own default color. 
               Therefore, it doesn't inherit the color </p>
            <p>We can force the <a class="anchor" href="https://github.com">anchor</a> element to inherit the color</p>
            <P>Even though it is not really common to make the anochor elements to inherit the color from the parent, because we want to stand them out</P>
