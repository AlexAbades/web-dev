       <h1>First HTML</h1> 
       <p>Welcome to HTML file, another <em>introduction!</em></p>
       <p>
        While we work with html documents, desinging the pages and their structure, we ofeten don't want to worry about the text
        content of the page. We can write those after we write the code of the page
       </p>
       <p>
        For that reason, we use sample placeholder text like this
        <i lang="la">Lorem impsum</i>:
       </p>

       <blockquote lang="la">
        Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. 
        Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,
        when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type
        specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into
        electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in 
        the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, 
        and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including
        versions of Lorem Ipsum.

            <li>First we created the HTML file</li>
            <li>Then we have introduced some text, like:</li>
            <ol>
                <li>Head</li>
                <li>Body</li>
                <li>Hyper Links</li>
            </ol>
            <li>Afterwards, we created a css file to modify the components of the html file</li>
